# Cryptocurrency-Analysis-and-Prediction

Cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency similar to dollars, euros, and yen. The difference
is that instead of the backing of a nation or federal bank, it uses an online ledger with strong
cryptography to secure online transactions. Through cryptocurrency exchanges, one can buy
and sell cryptocurrencies. It can also be “mined.” It is a digital medium of exchange that is
encrypted and decentralized. Many people use cryptocurrencies as a form of investing because
it gives great returns even in a short period. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Doge Coin are among the
popular cryptocurrencies today. With increasing geopolitical and economic issues over the last
two years, global currency values have fallen, stock markets have had a bad run, and investors
have lost wealth. This has rekindled interest in digital currencies.
